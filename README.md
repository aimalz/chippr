# chippr

Cosmological Hierarchical Inference with Probabilistic Photometric Redshifts.

## Motivation

This repository is the home of `chippr`, a Python package for estimating quantities of cosmological interest from surveys of photometric redshift posterior probability distributions.  It is a refactoring of my previous [work](https://github.com/aimalz/prob-z) on probabilistic photometric redshifts.

## Examples

You can browse the demo notebook here in this repo:

* [Basic  Demo for Python 2.7](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/aimalz/chippr/blob/master/docs/notebooks/demo2.html)

## Documentation

Documentation can be found on [ReadTheDocs](http://chippr.readthedocs.io/en/master/).  The draft of the paper documenting the details of the method can be found [here](https://github.com/aimalz/chippr/blob/master/research/paper/draft.pdf).

## People

* [Alex Malz](https://github.com/aimalz/qp/issues/new?body=@aimalz) (NYU)
